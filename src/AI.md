## Advantages of Joining Our Beta Testing Program

#### Exclusive Access: 

Be among the first to experience the most **secure and private** AI technology designed specifically for the education sector. Our on-premises solution respects more than the [Canadian Privacy Act](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/pa-lprp/pa-lprp.html), ensuring your data never leaves your control and providing unmatched security and peace of mind.

What doesn't mean to have all your data private? Keeping your data private means knowing that others can't read in on what you're doing. Can't snoop on you and your students as they learn and grow and won't be able to learn and figure out how to manipulate you. Control of your data is essential as more and more tools come out that can craft believable messaging as we enter time where generative AI allows for rapid development of persuasive arguments privacy is more important than ever. 

Don't let organizations snoop over your shoulder in ways that you do not want.
